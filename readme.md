# OpenStory

Hello. This is, simply put, a project to make a reusable, pretty, open-source class library for [MapleStory](http://www.maplestory.com/ "MapleStory global home page") emulators, be it client or server ones. Feel free to use it.

# Contributing

Pull, branch, code, and poke me for a merge. I'll review it mercilessly and probably throw it away, but you never know!
But seriously, you could give me good ideas. So do it.

# Credits

Credits are written out in individual readme files like this one, and also in the code files where appropriate.

# License

This thing is supposedly licensed under the Apache 2 license. Although nobody's gonna honor that anyways, so the hell with it?
